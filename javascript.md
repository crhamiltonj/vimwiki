## What is it

- Javascript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented computer programming language.
- JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of web development (the other two are HTML and CSS)
- Today Javascript can be used in different places:
  - Client-Side: Javascript was traditionally only used in the browser
  - Server-Side: With node.js we can use JavaScript on the server too
- Javascript is what makes modern web development possible:
  - Dynamic effects and interactivity
  - Modern web applications thatn we can interact with
- Frameworks like React and Angular are 100% based on JavaScript: you need to master JavaScript in order to use them!
