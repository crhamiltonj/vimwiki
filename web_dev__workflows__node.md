# Node & NPM

## Why?

To provide automation and organization.  

### Automation - Saves time

If there is a task that has to be done more than once it should be automated.

### Organization - Saves Sanity

Prevents us from putting everything in one file. Makes it easy to figure out what to change and where it should live.

### Code Reuse

You can use other packages instead of writing your own.

## Node Package Manager

### Package management - Why?

- Consolidates the packages you would need in one place instead of going to each location where it is created.
- Keeps track of updates and bug fixes and/or allows you to get specific versions of a package.

### What types of packages

- Node packages -- Automation, Build Tools, Server Tasks
- Javascript and CSS -- Does not specifically have to do with Node

### Common commands

- `npm init -y` -- Creates a package.json file that keeps track of NPM package installs
- `npm install <package_name>` -- Installs a package into node_modules folder

## WebPack
