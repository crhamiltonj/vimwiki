## What is it

- Javascript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented computer programming language.
- JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of web development (the other two are HTML and CSS)
- Today Javascript can be used in different places:
  - Client-Side: Javascript was traditionally only used in the browser
  - Server-Side: With node.js we can use JavaScript on the server too
- Javascript is what makes modern web development possible:
  - Dynamic effects and interactivity
  - Modern web applications thatn we can interact with
- Frameworks like React and Angular are 100% based on JavaScript: you need to master JavaScript in order to use them!

## Comments

- JavaScript comments
  - Single line comments are `//`
  - Multiline comments are `/* */`

## Variables

A container to store a value that you can use over and over

### To declare a variable

```javascript
var firstName = "John";
```

- Use the var keyword to tell javascript that you are creating a variable
- the item on the left side is the name of the variable
- the item on the right side is the value the variable contains

## Datatypes

- Number: Floating point numbers for decimals and integers
- String: Sequence of characters, used for text
- Boolean: Logical data type that can only be `true` or `false`
- Undefined: Data type of a variable that does not have a value yet
- Null: Also means 'non-existant`

Javascript has dynamic typing: data types are automatically assigned to variables

## Variable Names

- Variable names should be descriptive
- Javascript convention is to use camelCase variable names
  - the first letter is lowercase
  - each following word the first letter is uppercase

### Rules

- Variables cannot start or contain characters with numbers or symbols that are not \\\\_ or \$
- Reserved JavaScript keywords cannot be used as variable names

## Variable Mutation and Type Coercion

- Type Coercion -- JavaScript automatically converts certain variables so that the can be combined with other variables of another type.
